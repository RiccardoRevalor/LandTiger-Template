# LandTiger ARM Cortex-M3 Peripheral Template

This repository provides a ready-to-use template for quickly working with the peripherals of the LandTiger development board based on the ARM Cortex-M3 (LPC1768). It includes modular drivers, practical examples, and an organized structure for embedded projects.

## Why use it?
- Accelerate development with the LandTiger board.  
- Organize embedded projects in a modular and reusable way.  
- Access working examples for quick testing and implementation.  

## Academic Context  
This repository is designed to support coursework and projects for the following courses at Politecnico di Torino:  
- **Architetture dei Sistemi di Elaborazione** (course code: 02GOLOV).  
- **Computer Architecture** (English version of the same course).  

The template provides practical tools to simplify development with the LandTiger board, helping students focus on learning core concepts in embedded systems.  

## Landtiger NXP LPC1768
The code is written for the *Landtiger NXP LPC1768* used in Politecnico. <br/>
Meaningful informations about the chip composition:
- **ARM 32-bit Cortex-M3** microcontroller with MPU, CPU clock up to 100MHz
- 512kB on-chip Flash ROM
- 4x 32-bit Timers and a Repetitive Interrupt Controller 
- 64kB RAM, Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller
- Power Management Unit and Wakeup Interrupt Controller
The IDE used to develop this project is [Keil uVision](https://www2.keil.com/mdk5/uvision/).
